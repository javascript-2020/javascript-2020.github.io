A more complete solution as none of the other answers actually describe how to do it


Download a zipped directory right here in the browser by running this code snippet

The path can be empty ( therefore it will download all files in the repo )

            
            </div>


            <code-block src='full-ex.html' snippet-html api></code-block>
            
            <div>
            
A link to a GitHub webpage for a more complete example (work in progress)

javascript-2020.github.io : download a directory from a GitHub repository
            
            </div>
            
            <div>
As per the documentation REST API endpoints for Git trees : Get a tree
<br>
a complete list of files for a repo can be downloaded in json format by adding ?recursive=true to the endpoint
<br>
https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${repo}/git/trees/${branch}?recursive=true
each file can be downloaded individually from raw.githubusercontent.com
<br>
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${owner}/${repo}/${branch}/${path}
and the whole process only requires 1 github api request which helps with the github api rate restrictions, 60 p/hr anonymous, 5000 p/hr authorised, there is however a delay between updating a repo and those changes being reflected at raw.githubusercontent.com, this can be 5-10mins
<br>
Individual files can also be downloaded from ( changes reflected immediately )
<br>
https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${repo}/contents/${path}
To use authorized requests with the github api, a http header needs to be added to the request
<br>
authorization : bearer ${token}
A GitHub api token can be generated at github.com : Fine-grained personal access tokens, you'll need to add permissions / repository permissions / contents permission to the token
<br>
Given a successful request the api url will return a json object with the file data base64 encoded in the content field, such as
<br>
            
            </div>
            
            <code-block src='data-structure.js' snippet-console api></code-block>
            
            <div>
    
This structure can then be coupled with npm : jszip to create a zip file containing the files in the folder
            
            </div>
      
      </body>
