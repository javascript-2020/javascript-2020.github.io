            i first learnt to program on the 48k spectrum
            </div>
            
            <div>
            github.io : 48k spectrum
            https://javascript-2020.github.io/utils/html-editor/html-editor.html?1292093670806118400
            </div>
            
            <div>
            line numbers, screen resolution 32x24 characters,
            all entry and editing was done in the bottom 2 lines of the screen,
            the spectrum never had a renum command like the bbc micro so when you
            ran out of line numbers you had to go back and manually renumber them, that was fun
            </div>

            and p.s. there was nothing wrong with GOTO .. i still miss it today
            if youre thinking that the rubber keys were shite, this was considered
            an improvement on the zx81 with its hard plastic keys

            i taught myself to program, everything was block captials, luckily on the
            48k when you press a key the keyword comes up and i was able to figure out
            the parameters, plus you would always come across computer magazines in
            charity shops and car boots

            <div>
            i programmed my spectrum till all hours of the night and day, i eventually
            got a manual and taught myself machine code from a couple of listings
            in the back of the book

            </div>
            
            <div>
            these days i really appreciate my whitespace and i still have a phobia
            of capital letters in code
            </div>
            
            <div>
            what i personally cant stand, is something like this format
            </div>
            
            <code>
            
function fn(a, b, c) {
  if (!session) {
    cookie = ('' + Math.random()).slice(2);
    session = sessions.create(cookie);
    headers['set-cookie'] = `autofill=${cookie};httpOnly;SameSite=strict`;
  } else {
    user = users.find((user) => user.cookie == cookie);
  }
}           

            </code>
            
            <div>
            where theres spaces everywhere, it doesnt show too well in this example,
            but i can barely read it, i call it baby speak
            </div>
            
            <div>
            ive tried all manner of formatting, and although im always evolving and
            changing this is my preference for the time being, ive been formatting
            my code like that for about 10 years now
            </div>
            
            <div>
            anyway enough about my formatting and ive nearly exhausted my tolerance
            for using english
            </div>
            
            
            
      </body>
