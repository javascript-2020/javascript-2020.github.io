        I don’t write baby‑speak code.  
          
        If you need rainbow syntax highlighting and const‑everywhere to stop yourself from reusing a variable, maybe programming isn’t for you.  
          
        I believe in clean, concise, disciplined code: one declaration per line, wide indents that breathe on a 4K screen, and alignment that makes structure obvious without noise.  
          
        My style isn’t trendy — it’s timeless. Code should read like architecture, not like an unmade bed.





i would like to write a prettier config that formats code to my rather unique styling


ok i never have spaces in parenthesis or sqirly brackets or square brackets or after commas, i hate spaces everywhere i actually call it baby speakm code should clean and concise, the only reason people actually do that is because the rest of their formatting is soo bad the whole thing looks like an unmade bed, so i never have ( x ) i have (x) always same for squirly {x:1,b:2} same for square [1,2,3]



i might have to come back to it im in the middle of something else, is it a prettier plugin for eslint or the other way round, my current prettier setup is <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prettier@2.8.8/standalone.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prettier@2.8.8/parser-babel.js"></script> while im on the subject also, i might as well enquire, my 'baby-speak' also extends to mathematical expressions, i cannt stand stuff like x = 1 + 2 + 3; its just so daft, it should be x = 1+2+3;




oh i get you, but eslint wont reformat the code for me then, only prettier will do that, and if prettier aint got the rule for it im stuck having to manually go trhough and remove that baby stuff



oh my formatting goes much deeper than that, i actually have two tabs presses before an equals sign so var x = 1+2+3; but that there is the crux of why people need there baby speak, because without it, it just blends into one big code block and looks like an umade bed,



  that second for me becomes var x = 1+2+3; var longVariableName = 42; i always column align things in 'code block' that are teh same, lol



i'll chat with you some more about my bizarre formatting rules huh if something creates a major block ( except ifs theyre too common to bother with the squirly 'obviously' goes on the same line as the thing that opened it, switch, while, function, but then theres a blank line, you hit the squirly then double tap enter and you have your block opened up, no baby speak needed indentation is 6 spaces, i prefer to start my code 8 spaces from the left margin coz i hate it bunched against the margin like that no syntax highlighter, those things are just a random mess, they put me off


yeah 2 spaces isnt enough indentation, you dont want to have to stare at the code when you have a 4k screen or at least 1920 in front of you, 2 space indentation is bizarre and again just leads to baby speak because the code looks like an unmade bed



yeah i have prettier set up to do the best job it can, and it gets me half way there, i never have multiple statements in a var declaration, too easy to miss, one statement per var declaration so var x; var y; not var x,y; or worse var x,y,ade,b,g,t,d,hg, you know its like wtf, you add baby speak spacing in the middle of that lot and its a mess and dont get me started on const and let, why people start shouting that they everything be const and let because its better, ... better they demand.... then say nothing about them using function hoisting without even realising that it dont fit into theyre baby speak philosophy, its like come back in 10-20 years when youve realised and chat to me then



ok yeah, it'll give me head start to open my cv ( website ) with hahahah anyway the amount of time i have spend chaging things back from baby-speak to clean, concise programming really does my head in, after all if youre that bloody worried that you might accidentally reuse a variable declared with var and cause the whole company to be hacked, maybe computer programming aint for you huh lol


yeah ok, a full coding manifesto section, can you go back to all the things weve discussed here? give a full summary, including the humour i aint looking to hurt anyones feelings, its just how i code, if theyre that put off by style run it through a formatter you'll be write the other thing i cant stand is comments mixed into the actual code itself, all my comments start at the print margin 80 spaces, they are not part of the code itself and just get in the way

  theres no one liners in production code, theyre ok for 'simple' functions that do a simple thing, that are just utilities that do a simple little thing, other than that its one programming operation per line
