🧠 1. arXiv (the real heartbeat of modern computing research)
This is the place where new ideas appear first — often months before journals.

Most computing researchers subscribe to daily alerts for categories like:

cs.AI – artificial intelligence

cs.LG – machine learning

cs.DC – distributed computing

cs.OS – operating systems

cs.AR – architecture

cs.CR – cybersecurity

cs.PL – programming languages

cs.NI – networking

cs.SE – software engineering

arXiv is where companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI publish early work.

📧 2. Mailing lists that industry researchers actually follow
These are surprisingly influential.

• ACM SIGPLAN, SIGOPS, SIGARCH mailing lists
For programming languages, operating systems, and architecture.

• IETF mailing lists
For networking standards and protocol development.

• Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML)
The beating heart of systems programming.
Engineers from Intel, Red Hat, Google, and others follow it religiously.

• LLVM mailing lists
Compiler engineers live here.

• Apache Foundation mailing lists
For distributed systems, big data, and cloud infrastructure.

These lists are where new ideas often appear before papers.

📚 3. Journals (less dominant than in other sciences, but still important)
In computing, conferences matter more than journals — but journals still play a role.

Key ones include:

Communications of the ACM (CACM)

IEEE Computer

ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS)

ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)

IEEE Transactions on Computers

Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)

Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning

These are more “slow burn” sources — deeper, more polished work.

🎤 4. Conferences (the real powerhouse of computing research)
Unlike physics or biology, computer science is conference‑driven.

The big ones:

Systems & Architecture
OSDI

SOSP

ASPLOS

ISCA

Machine Learning
NeurIPS

ICML

ICLR

Security
USENIX Security

Black Hat

DEF CON

IEEE S&P

Networking
SIGCOMM

NSDI

Programming Languages
PLDI

POPL

Industry engineers follow these closely — often more than journals.

🌐 5. Community hubs (where ideas spread fastest)
These are the “informal” channels that matter more than people admit.

• Hacker News
Surprisingly influential for early‑stage ideas.

• Reddit communities
r/MachineLearning

r/ProgrammingLanguages

r/Compilers

r/Networking

r/AskNetsec

• Twitter/X (for researchers)
Many breakthroughs circulate here first.

• GitHub trending
New tools and frameworks often appear here before papers.

• Company blogs
Google, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple publish cutting‑edge research summaries.

🧩 6. Internal channels inside companies
This is the part outsiders don’t see.

Big tech companies have:

internal mailing lists

weekly research digests

reading groups

seminar series

internal Slack/Teams channels

“paper of the week” clubs

Engineers often read papers during work hours — it’s considered part of staying sharp.
