This code module implements a lightweight HTTPS server that exposes direct file system operations to the browser through a simple fetch‑based API. By sending requests such as

js
fetch("https://localhost:3000/a.txt", { headers: { mode: "load" } })
the browser can interact with local files securely and consistently.

Supported operations include:

load → retrieve file contents

save → write or overwrite file data

file delete → remove a file

dir read → list directory contents

dir create → make a new directory

dir delete → remove a directory

Together, these commands provide a complete set of standard file I/O capabilities accessible from the browser. This member sits at the Code stage of the pipeline: more substantial than a library, since it defines a working server with a defined protocol, but not yet a full project. It serves as a foundation for building browser‑driven file management tools, developer utilities, or experimental web‑native applications.
