                        This code module implements a lightweight HTTPS server that exposes direct file system operations to the browser through a simple fetch‑based API. By sending requests such as
                  </p>
                  
                  <code>
                  
      fetch("https://localhost:3000/a.txt", { headers: { mode: "load" } })
      
                  </code>
                  
                  <p>
                        the browser can interact with local files securely and consistently.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                        Supported operations include:
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                        load → retrieve file contents
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                        save → write or overwrite file data
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                        file delete → remove a file
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                        dir read → list directory contents
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                        dir create → make a new directory
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                        dir delete → remove a directory
                  </p>

                        Together, these commands provide a complete set of standard file I/O capabilities accessible from the browser. This member sits at the Code stage of the pipeline: more substantial than a library, since it defines a working server with a defined protocol, but not yet a full project. It serves as a foundation for building browser‑driven file management tools, developer utilities, or experimental web‑native applications.
