node-x is a script launcher for node.js

it works by maintaining a list of directories and then a script from any of those directories or their sub directories
can be launched by node-x from anywhere on the command line

``` node-x server.js ```

<br>

a directory can be added to node-x directory list by

``` node-x add /work/tmp ```


adds the directory /work/tmp to the directory list

``` node-x add . ```

adds the current directory to node-x

<br>

long commands can be aliased to short words, so a command such as

``` node server.js -p 4000 -cwd /work/www/ -ip 127.0.0.2 ```

could be aliased as

``` node-x server ```

<br>

node-x supports multiple configurations that can be switched in and out

a configuration consists of a list of directories and aliases
